title: Introduction

This package provides the `TheTVDB` class, which facilitates interaction with various endpoints of TheTVDB API.

## Parameters

To instantiate the TheTVDB class, provide your valid TVDB API token:

| Params | Type     | Required | Description         |
| ------ | -------- | :------: | ------------------- |
| token  | `string` |   Yes    | Your TVDB API token |

## Throws exceptions

The package throws exceptions in two key scenarios:

- Token
  :::danger[Error]

  Thrown when a `token` is not provided during class instantiation.

  :::

- Response.ok

  > For more information about the `ok` property, refer to the official documentation:
  > https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/ok

  :::danger[RangeError]

  Thrown when a response from `TheTVDB API` indicates an issue (response.ok is false).

  Potential causes include:

  - Incorrect query or path parameters
  - Authorization errors
  - Server-side problems

## Best Practices

When making requests with this package, we strongly recommend using try-catch blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions arising from asynchronous operations. This practice promotes application stability and provides opportunities for informative error messaging.

```ts
interface TVDBErrorCause {
  status: number;
  resJSON: unknown;
}

try {
  const client = new TheTVDB('access token');
  const { data } = await client.artworkById('63237874');
} catch (error: unknown) {
  if (error instanceof RangeError) {
    // Handle errors based on the response status
    if ((error.cause as TVDBErrorCause).status === 401) {
      console.log('Received Unauthorized response');
    }
  } else {
    console.error('Caught other error type:', error);
  }
}
```
